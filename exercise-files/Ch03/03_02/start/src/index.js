// createStore expects one argument at minimum: the reducer function used by the store
const store = createStore(appReducer)
// now, the store holds state and manages state

// READ current state
// you can look at the current state using getState()
// by default, just using appReducer, our initial state will be created by all the default variables we created by every reducer

// the store will use the appReducer to help calculate the initial state
// once every reducer is invoked once, the default value of that reducer will be saved as the initial state

// UPDATE (mutate)
// dispatch dispatches actions that mutates the state
// this should add a ski day to the state of all ski days.
